/**
 * This is an example startup benchmark.
 *
 * It navigates to the device's home screen, and launches the default activity.
 *
 * Before running this benchmark:
 * 1) switch your app's active build variant in the Studio (affects Studio runs only)
 * 2) add `<profileable android:shell="true" />` to your app's manifest, within the `<application>` tag
 *
 * Run this benchmark from Studio to see startup measurements, and captured system traces
 * for investigating your app's performance.
